Assignments in this course fall into three categories:
1. [Homework](#homework)
2. [Reading Quizzes](#reading-quizzes)
3. [Peer Review](#peer-review)
4. [Final Project](/finalproject)

With few exceptions, assignments will be turned in using [Observable.io](https://observablehq.com/) and submitted through the course LMS as a shareable link. You will provide the final project using [GitHub](https://github.com) and will require you to gain familiarity with online version control. For any web programming assignments it is recommended that students download and become comfortable with an IDE capable of web programming IDE such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

## Reading Quizzes
Participate in weekly quizzes focused on the readings. The quizzes will mostly consist of multiple-choice questions with some fill-in-the-blank exercises. You can submit your answers at any time before the deadline, and two retakes are allowed.

## Peer Review
At various points in the semester you will be asked to provide feedback on work submitted by your peers. Guidelines on how to provide constructive criticism and support will be discussed in class. Your ability to provide extensive feedback will be assessed and will constitute part of your grade for this course.

# Undergraduate vs Graduate
If you are enrolled as a graduate student, there will be additional readings assigned and additional requirements for each assignment. Be sure to check the course LMS for detailed guidance on each assignment.
