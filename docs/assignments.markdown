Assignments in this course fall into three categories:
1. [Homework](#homework)
2. [Labs](#labs)
4. [Final Project](/finalproject)

With few exceptions, assignments will be turned in using [Observable.io](https://observablehq.com/) and submitted through the course LMS as a shareable link. You will provide the final project using [GitHub](https://github.com) and will require you to gain familiarity with online version control. For any web programming assignments it is recommended that students download and become comfortable with an IDE capable of web programming IDE such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

## Homework

1. Tabular Data Analysis
2. Spatial Data Mapping
3. Interactive Network Data Analysis

## Labs
Participate with the instructor and your peers during in-class walkthroughs for building interactive visualizations. These have an in-class participation check followed by a take-home "on your own" completion check. They will be released on GitHub for you to review and submit.

# Undergraduate vs Graduate
If you are enrolled as a graduate student, there will be additional readings assigned and additional requirements for each assignment. Be sure to check the course LMS for detailed guidance on each assignment.
