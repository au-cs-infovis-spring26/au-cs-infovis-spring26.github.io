Assignments in this course fall into three categories:
1. [Homework](#homework)
2. [Labs](#labs)
4. [Final Project](/finalproject)

With few exceptions, assignments will be turned in using Canva. You will provide the final project using [GitHub](https://github.com) and will require you to gain familiarity with online version control. For any web programming assignments it is recommended that students download and become comfortable with an IDE capable of web programming IDE such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or VS Code.

## Homework
Assignments regularly change, but often conform to one of the following topics. Check the course LMS for detailed instructions during your semester. The Homework assignments are intended to help you develop your skills in designing data visualizations based on the theories we will discuss in class. They will involve little to no coding beyond what you choose to explore on your own. 

1. Tabular Data Analysis
2. Spatial Data Mapping
3. Interactive Network Data Analysis
4. Data Wrangling
5. Design Workshops

## Labs
Participate with the instructor and your peers during in-class walkthroughs for building interactive visualizations. This is the practical side of the course, where you will develop the coding skills necessary to put the theories we have discussed into practice as interactive visualizations. These have an in-class participation check followed by a take-home "on your own" completion check. They will be released on GitHub for you to review and submit.

# Undergraduate vs Graduate
If you are enrolled as a graduate student, there will be additional readings assigned and additional requirements for each assignment. Be sure to check the course LMS for detailed guidance on each assignment.
